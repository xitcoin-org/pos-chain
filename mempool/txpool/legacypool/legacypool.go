//
// The pool separates processable transactions (which can be applied to the

// two states over time as they are received and processed.
//
// In addition to tracking transactions, the pool also tracks a set of pending SetCode
// authorizations (EIP7702). This helps minimize number of transactions that can be
// trivially churned in the pool. As a standard rule, any account with a deployed
// delegation or an in-flight authorization to deploy a delegation will only be allowed a
// single transaction slot instead of the standard number. This is due to the possibility
// of the account being sweeped by an unrelated account.

// Because SetCode transactions can have many authorizations included, we avoid explicitly
// checking their validity to save the state lookup. So long as the encompassing
// transaction is valid, the authorization will be accepted and tracked by the pool. In
