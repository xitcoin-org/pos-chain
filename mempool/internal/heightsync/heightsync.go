// HeightSync synchronizes access to a per-height tx store for mempool
// implementations.
//
// At every new block height, mempools need to revalidate (recheck) their
// transactions against the latest chain state. This rechecking happens
// asynchronously — txs are validated one by one and pushed into a store as
// they pass. Meanwhile, block proposers may need to read from that store to
// build the next block.
//
// HeightSync solves this coordination problem. It holds a Store per height
// that producers populate via Do (e.g. during rechecking), and that consumers
// read via GetStore. GetStore blocks until either all operations for the
// requested height are complete (EndCurrentHeight is called) or the caller's
// context times out, whichever comes first. This lets block builders wait for
// the full set of rechecked txs when time permits, while still returning
// partial results under time pressure rather than holding a lock on the
// mempool itself.
