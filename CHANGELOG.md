- [\#1130](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/pull/1130) Use `sdk.ValidateAuthority` in `x/vm`, `x/erc20`, and `x/feemarket` `MsgServer` handlers so authority can optionally be centralized via the consensus `AuthorityParams` introduced in cosmos-sdk v0.54.
- [\#1164](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/pull/1164) Remove zero gas config from `ics20.transferWithStateDB` so inner KV ops in ICS20 transfer execution are metered, mirroring [\#1103](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/pull/1103).
